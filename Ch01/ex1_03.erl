sum_squares_2_largest(A, B, C) ->
    ArgsL    = [A, B, C],
    Lowest   = lists:min(ArgsL),
    Square   = fun(X) -> X * X end,
    SquaresL = lists:map(Square, ArgsL),
    lists:sum(SquaresL) - Square(Lowest).

% squaring all three args and then subtracting the square (again) of the lowest
% is not the most computationally efficient way to do this, but I wanted to show
% that it was functionally equivalent to the usual approach of selecting just the
% two highest and then squaring.
